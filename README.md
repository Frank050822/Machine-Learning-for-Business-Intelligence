## Bicycle Customers & Sales Analysis
### Brief Description:
Boulder Expeditions is an online Biking company focused on Mountain and Touring bikes. There are two main objectives of our project: customer segmentation and predicting customer behavior. The dataset includes following features of each customer: BirthDate, MaritalStatus, Gender, AnnualIncome, TotalChildren, EducationLevel, Occupation, HomeOwner, lat, lng, OrderDate, StockDate, OrderQuantity, ProductName, ModelName, ProductCost, ProductPrice

### Objective / Solved Problem
1. Target marketing based on customer segmentation¶
We use K-Means to divide our customers into 4 different groups, and then marketing department employees can utilize this information to target the 
customers. 
2. Predict customer behavior for potential purchase
Regression: Based on customer personal information, we can predict how much money such customers would like to spend in the future. 
3. Create a product recommendation system
Classification: Based on customer personal information, we can predict which bicycles s/he may be interested in buying, so we can target our customers
with different marketing strategy.
